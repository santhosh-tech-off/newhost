Education – A golden key that opens up a whole new world of opportunity, yet millions of the meritorious underprivileged are deprived of the same, especially the children. In the journey of their lifetimes, they walk in the narrow path of illiteracy, ignorance and poverty. Everyone has the right to get education and in line with this thinking Aarthi Educational and charitable Trust runs the following institutions ,
1. K.S.R. College of Engineering
2. K.S.R. Institute of Engineering and Technology
3. K.S.R. Polytechnic College.</p>
